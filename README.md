# Vet-clinic

This project used the relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. Apart from the building data structure, here will be challenged with tasks that require SQL queries to answer specific questions.

## Built with

- SQL
- Postgresql

## Get Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

 ```
   git clone <URL> in your terminal
   ```

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) to list of queries
